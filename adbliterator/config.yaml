SETTINGS:
  # 'debug' will log everything, *can* reduce performance but
  # will show requests being blocked in realtime
  # and will help figure out issues if you are having any
  debug: false
  
  # 'port' changes the port to serve on
  port: 13453
  
  # 'dns' settings can be complex, this chooses what resolves the domains
  # you visit. If you don't understand, we by default use 
  # Cloudflare for primary and backup, they are the fastest and
  # work well, you could also use Google Ads or other providers.
  dns:
    primary: "1.1.1.1"
